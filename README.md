# GlobalAzureBootcam-RacingLab
The GAB Racing Game Lab will bring together the attendees of the Global Bootcamp locations around the world to cooperate and compete in a 3D driving game using Azure for back-end game services. The game allows players to drive laps, score points, and unlock achievements for their country as they compete to set the fastest lap times on the three tracks in the game.  There is also a hands-on lab which will walk through the creation of an Azure Web App that will list the best lap times for your location or country, and include challenge stages to create animated driver trackers for those who love to be creative with JavaScript.
